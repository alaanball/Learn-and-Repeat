Problem Statement

To a design a robot which can repeat a path it has already been manually navigated across

Relevance

Such a robot could be used to reliably move light items such as paperwork or memos from one place to another.

Methodology

A prototype of the robot will first be designed using a FIREBIRD(TM) robot. Once the prototype works as expected, a robot
will be designed from scratch - this includes the selection of motors to drive the wheels, design of the power supply to 
the motors, microcontrollers, sensors, and ICs required. The method of learning and repeating a path will be based on the
approximating the location of the robot using the rotation of wheels. A GPS module can also be use to initialize the 
position the bot to within a few metres of accuracy. The robot should be able able to navigate through reasonably complicated
regions and should also be able to make adjustments to the path in case it encounters any obstacles, so the accuracy of 
the algorithms involved will be a crucial factor. 

Expected outcomes

A basic working model of the robot.
